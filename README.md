## How these notes were generated
1. PDF to Word Converter for the huge pdf.
2. Breaking down into smaller chunks and asking ChatGPT to summarize.
3. This result will be in markdown, so open an ipynb file and combine all the results for reach topic/chapter.
4. Export as HTML (export as pdf didn't seem to work).
5. Print that HTML file as pdf.
6. This being an ipynb file, images and other changes can be added whenever we want.

## Incase you want to update this project:
1. Try using the export as PDF option instead of taking as html then converting to pdf, so that some of these sub headings don't get cut half way due to page breaks.
2. Try to incorporate images wherever possible in the ipynb file using the markdown option and convert that into pdf. Commit here so that that can be merged.


Hope this helps, cheers
